<br>From the command above, the option:

    -b : runs top in batch mode
    -o : used to specify fields for sorting processes
    head utility displays the first few lines of a file and
    the -n option is used to specify the number of lines to be displayed.

Note that head utility, by default displays the first ten lines of a file, that is when you do not specify the number of lines to be displayed. Therefore, in the example above, we displayed the first 22 lines of top command output in batch mode.
