## What are the basic types of IT monitoring?

The basic types of IT monitoring include availability monitoring, web performance monitoring, web application management and application performance management, API management, real user monitoring, security monitoring and business activity monitoring.

While there’s no completely canonical list of the various types of IT monitoring tools, many terms include multiple types of monitoring, blurring the lines that define this market. Here’s a look at the general types of tools that comprise IT monitoring:

    Availability monitoring: Often referred to as system monitoring, availability monitoring is arguably the most mature type of IT monitoring tool. Including categories such as server management, infrastructure monitoring/management and network monitoring/management, this is designed to provide users with information about uptime and the performance of whatever is being monitored.
    Web performance monitoring: A subset of availability monitoring, web performance monitoring is designed to monitor the availability of a web server or service, but also adds more fine-grained detail to the system. These tools can capture information such as page loading time, the location of errors that are generated, and individual load times of various web elements, helping analysts to fine-tune a website or a web-based app’s performance.
    Application management/application performance management (APM): APM tools are similar to web performance monitoring tools, but they’re designed with customer-facing applications in mind, allowing analysts to track the performance of an application and spot any issues before they become too severe for the user base. More modern APM tools can include automated routines to troubleshoot these issues without the intervention of a human developer.
    API monitoring: Enterprises that offer APIs to third-party developers will find it crucial to ensure the uptime of these services. API monitoring tools and monitoring software provide insight into whether an API is working properly, ensuring minimal downtime.
    Real user monitoring (RUM): Real user monitoring is designed to record actual end-user interactions with a website or application. By monitoring real-world load times and user behavior, it can pinpoint problems based on “real” user experience challenges, as opposed to simulations. This type of monitoring is designed to be backward-looking, not predictive, allowing analysts to spot problems only after they occurred.
    Security monitoring: Security monitoring is a highly specific type of IT monitoring, designed to observe a network for breaches or other unusual activity. Security monitoring is a broad, high-level category that includes numerous subsets of security analysis tools.
    Business activity monitoring (BAM): This type of monitoring tool takes key business performance metrics and tracks them over time. For example, these metrics could include information about retail sales, application downloads or the volume of financial transfers.

Note that all of these tools may be tasked with monitoring on-premise equipment or applications and may be used in conjunction with cloud-based systems, or both.
