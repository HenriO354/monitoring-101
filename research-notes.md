# What are the **most memory intensive** running processing ?

##  Process:    ##
A process may refer to :
- A **set of instructions** 
being processed by the computer processor.

For example, in Windows you can see each of the processes running by opening the Processes tab in Task Manager. Windows Processes are Windows Services and background programs you normally don't see running on the computer. A process may be a printer program that runs in the background and monitors the ink levels and other printer settings while the computer is running.

A typical computer has multiple processes running all the time to help manage the operating system, its hardware, and the software running on the computer.

Here is an example on how the list of top processes ordered by RAM and CPU use in descendant form (remove the pipeline and head if you want to see the full list):

The following command will show the list of top processes ordered by RAM and CPU use in descendant form (remove the pipeline and head if you want to see the full list):

## Find Top Running Processes by Highest Memory and CPU Usage in Linux##

I remember once reading that efficient system administrators are lazy people. The reason is not that they’re not doing their job or wasting their time – it is mostly because they have automated a good deal of their routine tasks. Thus, they don’t have to babysit their servers and can use their time to learn new technologies and always stay at the top of their game.

Part of automating your tasks, is learning how to get a script do what you would have to do yourself otherwise. Continually adding commands to your own knowledge base is just as important.

For that reason, in this article we will share a trick to find out, which processes are consuming lots of Memory and CPU utilization in Linux.

![This is an image](/assets/images/Find-Top-Processes-By-RAM-and-CPU-Usage.png)

Brief explanation of above options used in above command:

The -o (or –format) option of ps allows you to specify the output format. A favorite of mine is to show the processes’ PIDs (pid), PPIDs (pid), the name of the executable file associated with the process (cmd), and the RAM and CPU utilization (%mem and %cpu, respectively).

Additionally, I use --sort to sort by either %mem or %cpu. By default, the output will be sorted in ascendant form, but personally I prefer to reverse that order by adding a minus sign in front of the sort criteria.

To add other fields to the output, or change the sort criteria, refer to the OUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL section in the man page of ps command.

# What are log files ?
Linux Logging Basics

Operating system logs provide a wealth of diagnostic information about your computer, and Linux is no exception. 

Everything from kernel events to user actions are logged by Linux, allowing you to see almost any action performed on your servers. In this section, we’ll explain what Linux logs are, where you can find them, and how to interpret them.

Linux System Logs

Linux has a special directory for storing logs called /var/log. This directory contains logs from the OS itself, services, and various applications running on the system. Here’s what this directory looks like on a typical Ubuntu system.

*Where* can you find them on a *typical Linux* system ?
![This is an image](/assets/images/System-log-terminal.png)

Some of the most important Linux system logs include:

/var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages store all global system activity data, including startup messages. Debian-based systems like Ubuntu store this in /var/log/syslog, while Red Hat-based systems like RHEL or CentOS use /var/log/messages.

/var/log/auth.log and /var/log/secure store all security-related events such as logins, root user actions, and output from pluggable authentication modules (PAM). Ubuntu and Debian use /var/log/auth.log, while Red Hat and CentOS use /var/log/secure.

/var/log/kern.log stores kernel events, errors, and warning logs, which are particularly helpful for troubleshooting custom kernels.

/var/log/cron stores information about scheduled tasks (cron jobs). Use this data to verify that your cron jobs are running successfully.

Some applications also write log files in this directory. For example, the Apache web server writes logs to the /var/log/apache2 directory (on Debian), while MySQL writes logs to the /var/log/mysql directory. Some applications also log via syslog.

Syslog Format and Fields

Syslog messages contain a standardized header with several fields. These include the timestamp, the name of the application that generated the event, the location in the system where the message originated, and its priority. You can change this format in your syslog implementation’s configuration file, but using the standard format makes it easier to parse, analyze, and route syslog events.

Here is an example log message using the default format. It’s from the sshd daemon, which controls remote logins to the system. This message describes a failed login attempt:

Jun 4 22:14:15 server1 sshd[41458] : Failed password for root from 10.0.2.2 port 22 ssh2

You can also add additional fields to your syslog messages. Let’s repeat the last event after adding a few new fields. We’ll use the following rsyslog template, which adds the priority (<%pri%>), protocol version (%protocol-version%), and the date formatted using RFC 3339 (%timestamp:::date-rfc3339%):

<%pri%>%protocol-version% %timestamp:::date-rfc3339% %HOSTNAME% %app-name% %procid% %msgid% %msg%n

This generates the following log:

<34>1 2019-06-05T22:14:15.003Z server1 sshd - - pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=10.0.2.2

Below, you’ll find descriptions of some of the most commonly used syslog fields when searching or troubleshooting issues.

Timestamp

The timestamp field indicates the time and date the message was generated on the system sending the message. The example timestamp breaks down like this:

    “2019-06-05”is the year, month, and day.
    “T”is a required element of the timestamp field, separating the date and the time.
    “22:14:15.003”is the 24-hour format of the time, including the number of milliseconds (003).
    “Z”indicates UTC time. Instead of z, the example could have included an offset, such as -08:00, which indicates that the time is offset from UTC by eight hours.

Hostname

The hostname field (“server1” in the example above) indicates the name of the host or system that originally sent the message.

App-Name

The app-name field (“sshd:auth” in the example) indicates the name of the application that sent the message.

Priority

The priority field or pri for short (“<34>” in the example above) tells you how urgent or severe the event is. It’s a combination of two numerical fields: the facility and the severity. The facility specifies the type of process that created the event, ranging from 0 for kernel messages to 23 for local applications. The severity ranges from 0–7, with 0 indicating an emergency and 7 indicating a debug event.

Pri can be output in two ways. The first is as a single number, prival, which is calculated as the facility field value multiplied by eight, then the result is added to the severity field value: (facility)(8) + (severity). The second is pri-text, which will output in the string format “facility.severity”. The latter format can often be easier to read and search, but takes up more storage space.
Logging with Systemd

Many Linux distributions ship with systemd, which is a process and service manager. Systemd implements its own logging service called journald that can replace or complement syslog. Journald logs in a significantly different manner than systemd, which is why it has its own section in the Ultimate Guide to Logging. You can learn more about logging via systemd in the Systemd Logging section.
